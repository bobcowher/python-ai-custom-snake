This project contains a combination of a simple reinforcement learning script and a custom version of "snake"
programmed for OpenAI's gym. To use the environment, install the requirements.txt, which should include a pip
install of the local snake directory.

Much of this code is inspired by or copied from Jose Portilla's course on Udemy.
